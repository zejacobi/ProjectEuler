# ProjectEuler
![current progress](https://projecteuler.net/profile/zedjacobi.png)

Here so that I can steadily and publicly work my way through the problems on 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). See also my 
[Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/zacharyjacobi/euler).

Warning that this contains (obviously) spoilers for Project Euler. If you want
the satisfaction of figuring out the problems on your own, you probably shouldn't
be reading my answers!

## Funniest Solutions
These are the solutions where I do something ridiculous (or clever) and are the ones I recommend
checking out if you want to get a sense for the kind of programming I find interesting:

* 2
* 5
* 7
* 11
* 14
* 19
