# ProjectEuler
![current progress](https://projecteuler.net/profile/zedjacobi.png)

Here so that I can steadily and publicly work my way through the problems on 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). See also my 
[Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/zacharyjacobi/euler).

Warning that this contains (obviously) spoilers for Project Euler. If you want
the satisfaction of figuring out the problems on your own, you probably shouldn't
be reading my answers!

Out of extreme laziness, I've added a short-cut to running the most recent solution. All you have
to do is run `python ./run.py -l` from the main directory. This was also kind of
necessary to have a sane module structure. 

To run a specific solution, use `python ./run.py -n 1` (this will run solution 1). It will raise
an error if the requested solution doesn't exist. You don't have to worry about padding, that 
takes care of itself. 

## Funniest Solutions
These are the solutions where I do something ridiculous (or clever) and are the ones I recommend
checking out if you want to get a sense for the kind of programming I find interesting:

* 2
* 5
* 7
* 11
* 14
* 19
* 25
* 32
* 34
* 35
* 49
* 50

## Problems With A Bonus Solution
Occasionally, I try to come up with a quick and dirty approximate solution or show another way
to do a problem. These can be interesting.
